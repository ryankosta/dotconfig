# dotconfig
Ryan Kosta's dot configs

---------Intro-------------------
These are the dotconfig files I use on a daily basis.
The script directory contains some ad-hoc installation scripts for some of what I use, though not all of it.
Many of these configuration files are autogenerated and edited, or edited from another source.
---------------------------------

---------License Info------------
I provide these files with no license.
I plan to find the license of all the files contained within and at that time provide a license that permits those sublicenses.
Any person using these files is responsible to discover, read, and follow licenses of the files within.
I offer no warranty implied or otherwise and people using these files use them at their own risk.
---------------------------------

-------Todo----------------------
Write more scripts to automate installation of these .config files possibly using a configuration management tool such as ansible.
---------------------------------

-------Goal----------------------
Offer an easy mechanism to get to a configured system from scratch that is compatable across multiple unix-like operating systems.
